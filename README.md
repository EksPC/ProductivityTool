# Productivity tool
### Introduction
This is a Java application designed to assist with time management and task organization. 
It's an improved to-do list that implements a simple calendar to visualise the number of tasks remaining for each date.

### Features
Calendar: Keep track of how many tasks you have to complete in certain date.
To-Do List: Create and manage tasks with the to-do list feature, ensuring that important assignments and activities are not overlooked.
### Technologies Used
JavaFX: Study Tool is developed using JavaFX for the graphical user interface.
JUnit: JUnit is used for unit testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application's codebase.
JAXB: JAXB is used for XML data binding, allowing for the serialization and deserialization of data objects to and from XML format.

### Usage
Opening Productivity Tool, you will be presented with the main dashboard containing the current month visualisation, in every cell is displayed the number of tasks to complete. You can also visualise the tasks (both completed and not) expiring on a certain date by simply clicking on the corresponding cell.
In the todo-list section you can visualize both your lists with their tasks, but also a special list called **Today** where you can check for incoming expiration.
Use the navigation menu, situated to the left, to switch between calendar and to-do section.
